## ðŸŽ® About the Game

Snake is a classic 2D Arcade game that was quite popular in the 1990s and is still popular now. Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens. 

This game was created as a part of series on classic arcade games. This is an attempt to recreate the classic aracade game Snake. The background score used is the original background music from the original Snake game. You can play the game here: [lightlessdays.github.io/Snake](https://lightlessdays.github.io/Snake/).
